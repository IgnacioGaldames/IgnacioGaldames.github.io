descripcionLibro: Welcome to the Future! The future is one of our making and our writers are up to the task. In these pages you will encounter many wondrous stories on bio terrorism, weaponized dogs, genetically engineered humans, dystopian worlds and introspective androids. This is just to name a few situations, of course; the future is very unpredictableâ€”and sometimes very frightening. On the road up ahead are worlds characterized by lawlessness, dominating corporations, and governments unwilling to protect basic human rights. You better prepare yourself, because it may take all of your resources and creativity just to survive. Punk is the word; whether it is cyberpunk, post-cyberpunk, biopunk or solarpunk, you will discover what it means to be human in a changing world.
